        <p>
        The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton 
        devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. 
        It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined 
        by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with 
        the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing 
        how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal 
        constructor or any other Turing machine. </p>

        <h3>Rules</h3>

        <p>
            The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional 
            orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two 
            possible states, live or dead (or populated and unpopulated, 
            respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, 
            which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or 
            diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following 
            transitions occur: 
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, 
                as if by underpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives 
                on to the next generation.</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, 
                as if by overpopulation.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes 
                a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
          </ol>
